### C-NMC dataset

For the sake of fairness, we validate our proposed method mainly using the C-NMC da-taset, which contains cell images from 84 cancer and 70 normal subjects. This dataset is released in three phases: (1) Phase-I. The malignant and normal cell numbers were 7,272 and 3,389 for 47 cancer subjects and 26 normal subjects, respectively. (2) Phase-II. A total of 1,219 malignant cells from 13 cancer subjects and 648 normal cells from 15 normal subjects were released. (3) Phase-III. A total of 2,586 cell images without labels from 9 can-cer subjects and 8 normal subjects were released for online validation. All cell images are preprocessed via a stain-normalization procedure and a cell automated segmentation algorithm. Each image has a resolution of 450x450  pixels and contains only a single cell.

### PD dataset
The PD dataset consists of 1,478 images of acute lymphoblasts and 855 images of normal white blood cells collected at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. All cells were seg-mented from the microscopic images and labeled by experienced hematologists following the standard clinical protocol of Zhongshan Hospital.
